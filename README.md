# Alcademy Deep Research API

[![Alcademy](alcademy-logo.png)](https://github.com/alcademyorg)

> This is a fork of [Open Deep Research](https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research) by [@dzhng](https://x.com/dzhng), enhanced with REST API implementation and integrated into the CodeGuide platform.

An AI-powered research assistant that performs iterative, deep research on any topic by combining search engines, web scraping, and large language models. This enhanced version provides a REST API interface and is integrated into the [Alcademy platform](https://github.com/alcademyorg).

The core functionality remains true to the original project's goal of providing a simple implementation of a deep research agent - one that can refine its research direction overtime and deep dive into a topic.

## Access

This service is available to all Alcademy members at [app.Alcademy.dev](https://github.com/alcademyorg).
You'll have access to the following features:
- User-friendly interface for conducting research
- Real-time results and generated reports
- Integrations with other CodeGuide features (coming soon)



## How It Works

## Features

- **REST API Implementation**: Full REST API support with comprehensive documentation
- **CodeGuide Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with the CodeGuide platform
- **API Documentation**: Interactive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- **Iterative Research**: Performs deep research by iteratively generating search queries, processing results, and diving deeper based on findings
- **Intelligent Query Generation**: Uses LLMs to generate targeted search queries based on research goals and previous findings
- **Depth & Breadth Control**: Configurable parameters to control how wide (breadth) and deep (depth) the research goes
- **Smart Follow-up**: Generates follow-up questions to better understand research needs
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Produces detailed markdown reports with findings and sources
- **Concurrent Processing**: Handles multiple searches and result processing in parallel for efficiency

## API Usage

You can access the API locally or by self-hosting it.

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication that will be defined in the `.env` file.

```bash
# .env
API_KEY="your_development_api_key"
```

### Research Flow

The research process consists of three main steps:

1. **Generate Clarifying Questions**
```bash
# Step 1: Generate questions to better understand the research direction
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/research/questions \
  -H "x-api-key: API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Your research query",
    "numQuestions": 3
  }'
```

2. **Perform Deep Research**
```bash
# Step 2: Conduct the research with your answers to the clarifying questions
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/research \
  -H "x-api-key: API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Your research query",
    "breadth": 6,
    "depth": 3,
    "questionAnswers": [
      {
        "question": "Question from step 1",
        "answer": "Your answer to the question"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

3. **Generate Final Report**
```bash
# Step 3: Generate a comprehensive report using the research results
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/report \
  -H "x-api-key: API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Original research query",
    "learnings": ["Learning 1", "Learning 2"],  # From research response
    "visitedUrls": ["url1", "url2"]            # From research response
  }'
```

The flow allows for an iterative and thorough research process:
1. First, generate clarifying questions to better understand the research needs
2. Use these questions and your answers to guide the deep research process
3. Finally, generate a comprehensive report based on the research findings

## Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:

```bash
FIRECRAWL_KEY="your_firecrawl_key"
# If you want to use your self-hosted Firecrawl, add the following below:
# FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3002"

OPENAI_KEY="your_openai_key"

# API Configuration
PORT=3000
API_KEY="your_development_api_key"
```

## Running Locally

Start the API server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with documentation at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`.
